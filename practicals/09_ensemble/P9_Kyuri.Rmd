```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE,
               warning = FALSE,
               comment = NA)

```

# Introduction

First, load the packages:

```{r packages, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(caret)
library(gbm)
library(xgboost)
library(data.table)
library(ggforce)
```

First, we specify a seed and load the training data. We will use this data to make inferences and to train a prediction model.

```{r seed}
set.seed(123)
df <- readRDS("data/train_disease.RDS")
```

## 1. Get an impression of the data by looking at the structure of the data and creating some descriptive statistics.
```{r}
str(df)
# use skim
skimr::skim(df)

# use describeBy
df %>% select(-c(Disease, Gender)) %>% 
psych::describeBy(df$Disease, fast=T)
```

## 2. To further explore the data we work with, create some interesting data visualizations that show whether there are interesting patterns in the data.

```{r}
# to extract legend
p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Age, fill = Disease)) + geom_boxplot() +        scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") + theme(legend.direction = "vertical")
legend <- cowplot::get_legend(p1)

# create multiple boxplots
plots <- df %>% 
  select(-c(Disease, Gender)) %>% 
  names() %>% 
  map(~ggplot(df, aes_string(x = ., fill = "Disease")) + 
        geom_boxplot() +
        scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
        theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "none"))

cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = plots ,legend)
```

## 3. Shortly reflect on the difference between bagging, random forests, and boosting.
- Bagging: Fit a regression tree to N bootstrap samples of the training data, and take the average of all classification trees to base predictions on.  
*Note*: out-of-bag data can serve as internal validation set.

- Random forest: Similarly to bagging, classification trees are trained on a bootstrap sample of the data. However, the decision trees are trained using less than all features in the data. 

- Boosting: We build a decision tree sequentially. Given the current, we fit a (small) tree on the residuals of the current model, rather than on the outcome Y.

# Bagging
## 4. Apply bagging to the training data, to predict the outcome `Disease`, using the `caret` library.

*Note.* We first specify the internal validation settings, like so:

```{r cross-validation-settings}
cvcontrol <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", 
                          number = 10,
                          allowParallel = TRUE)
```

```{r}
bag_train <- train(Disease ~ .,
                   data = df, 
                   method = 'treebag',
                   trControl = cvcontrol,
                   importance = TRUE)
```

## 5. Interpret the variable importance measure using the `varImp` function on the trained model object.

```{r}
varImp(bag_train) %>% plot
```

## 6. Create training set predictions based on the bagged model, and use the `confusionMatrix()` function from the `caret` package to assess it's performance.

```{r}
preds <- predict(bag_train)
confusionMatrix(preds, df$Disease)
```

## 7. Now ask for the output of the bagged model. Explain why the under both approaches differ.

```{r}
bag_train
```

# Random Forest
## 8. Fit a random forest to the training data to predict the outcome `Disease`, using the `caret` library.

```{r}
rf_train <- train(Disease ~ .,
                  data = df, 
                  method = 'rf',
                  trControl = cvcontrol,
                  importance = TRUE)
```

## 9. Again, interpret the variable importance measure using the `varImp` function on the trained model object. Do you draw the same conclusions as under the bagged model?
No, slightly different.

```{r}
varImp(rf_train) %>%  plot
```


## 10. Output the model output from the random forest. Are we doing better than with the bagged model?

```{r}
rf_train
```

# Boosting
## 11. Now, fit a boosting model using the `caret` library to predict disease status.

```{r}
gbm_train <- train(Disease ~ .,
                   data = df,
                   method = "gbm",
                   verbose = F,
                   trControl = cvcontrol)
```


## 12. Again, interpret the variable importance measure. You will have to call for `summary()` on the model object you just created. Compare the output to the previously obtained variable importance measures.

```{r}
summary(gbm_train)
```


## 13. Output the model output from our gradient boosting procedure. Are we doing better than with the bagged and random forest model?

```{r}
gbm_train
```

## 14. Download the file `shap.R` from [this](https://github.com/pablo14/shap-values) Github repository.

*Note.* There are multiple ways to this, of which the simplest is to run the following code. 

```{r download-shap-functions, message = FALSE}
library(devtools)
source_url("https://github.com/pablo14/shap-values/blob/master/shap.R?raw=TRUE")
```

## 15. Specify your model as follows, and use it to create predictions on the training data.

```{r xgboost}
train_x <- model.matrix(Disease ~ ., df)[,-1]
train_y <- as.numeric(df$Disease) - 1
xgboost_train <- xgboost(data = train_x,
                         label = train_y, 
                         max.depth = 10,
                         eta = 1,
                         nthread = 4,
                         nrounds = 4,
                         objective = "binary:logistic",
                         verbose = 2)



pred <- tibble(Disease = predict(xgboost_train, newdata = train_x)) %>%
  mutate(Disease = factor(ifelse(Disease < 0.5, 1, 2),
                          labels = c("Healthy", "Disease")))

table(pred$Disease, df$Disease)
```

---

## 16. First, calculate the `SHAP` rank scores for all variables in the data, and create a variable importance plot using these values. Interpret the plot.

```{r make-shap}
shap_results <- shap.score.rank(xgboost_train,
                                X_train = train_x,
                                shap_approx = F)

var_importance(shap_results)
```

## 17. Plot the `SHAP` values for every individual for every feature and interpret them.
The first plot shows, for example, that those with a high value for `Direct_Bilirubin` have a lower probability of being diseased. Also, those with a higher `age` have a lower probability of being diseased, while those with a higher `Albumin` have a higher probability of being diseased.

The second set of plots displays the marginal relationships of the SHAP values with the predictors. This conveys the same information, but in greater detail. The interpretability may be a bit tricky for the inexperienced data analyst. 
```{r shap-plots}
shap_long <- shap.prep(shap = shap_results,
                       X_train = train_x)

plot.shap.summary(shap_long)

xgb.plot.shap(train_x, features = colnames(train_x), model = xgboost_train, n_col = 3)
```

# Evaluation
## 18. Verify which of the models you created in this practical performs best on the test data.
There isn't dramatic difference across the models.
But random forest and boosting seem to relatively work better than the other two models.
```{r test-models}
# load test dataset
test <- readRDS("data/test_disease.RDS")

bag_test <- predict(bag_train, newdata = test)
rf_test  <- predict(rf_train, newdata = test)
gbm_test <- predict(gbm_train, newdata = test)
xgb_test <- predict(xgboost_train, newdata = model.matrix(Disease ~ ., test)[,-1]) %>%
  factor(x = ifelse(. < 0.5, 1, 2), levels = c(1,2), labels = c("Healthy", "Disease"))

list(bag_test, 
     rf_test, 
     gbm_test, 
     xgb_test) %>%
  map(~ confusionMatrix(.x, test$Disease))
```
